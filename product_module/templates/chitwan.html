                    <h3>Trip to chitwan</h3>
                    <p>Chitwan National Park is a preserved area in the Terai Lowlands of south-central Nepal, known for its biodiversity. Its dense forests and grassy plains are home to rare mammals like one-horned rhinos and Bengal tigers. The park shelters numerous bird species, including the giant hornbill. Dugout canoes traverse the northern Rapti River, home to crocodiles. Inside the park is Balmiki Ashram, a Hindu pilgrimage site. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Chitwan National Park is the first national park of Nepal. It was established in 1973 and was granted the status of a World Heritage Site in 1984. It covers an area of 952.63 km2 (367.81 sq mi) and it is located in the subtropical Inner Terai lowlands of south-central Nepal in the districts of Nawalpur, Parasi, Chitwan and Makwanpur. In altitude it ranges from about 100 m (330 ft) in the river valleys to 815 m (2,674 ft) in the Shivalik Hills.</p>

                        <h4>Day 1: Drive to Chitwan (Approx: 185 km/5 hrs drive)
                        </h4>
                        <p>An enjoyable and scenic five hours drive by car or private vehicle on the Prithvi highway connecting Chitwan with Kathmandu follows the Trishuli River and takes us through the Tharu Villages of Chitwan. The ethnic tribe of the Tharuâ€™s are the local inhabitants of Chitwan and are agriculturists by profession. The drive finally brings us to the Tigerland Safari Resort.
                            Up on arrival at Tigerland Safari Resort the guests will be met and briefed by the Guest Relation officer regarding the park and the programs available. Lunch will be followed by a choice of activities arranged for you.

                        <h4>Day 02: (IN CHITWAN)
                        </h4>
                        <p>Early morning guests will be mounted on elephant backs and taken for a jungle safari for 23 hours penetrating through dense grasslands to view wildlife in their natural habitat. This grass commonly known as elephant grass is dense and grows to a height of 1820 ft. It is the favorite habitat for rhinoceros and other mammals.
                        </p>
                        <p>After breakfast, you are taken to our elephant stables where a senior naturalist briefs about the interesting and unbelievable habits of elephants. Here one may witness the rare scene of the elephants at bath.</p>
                        <p>In the afternoon you may choose to relax around the resort or take a drive through the jungles in a four wheel drive jeep followed by a canoe ride down the Rapti River. The river ride provides an opportunity of viewing the gharial crocodiles as well as the mugger crocodiles, freshwater dolphins, otters and varieties of water birds. You may also feel like going for a nature walk or bird watching with one of our naturalists to know more about the flora of the Chitwan National Park. Those on canoe ride are taken back to the resort four wheel drive jeep from the end point.</p>
